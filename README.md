### Quickstart

#### I don't need to script

OK then. You'll find a nice folder structure for your project, already filled with the original Spark AR Assets! 
Just save your Spark Project inside "/spark-project/" and have fun!

#### I actually want to script

1. ```npm install``` to install the depencies. 
Use npm to install other plugins. 

2. Do your magic in ```/scripts/script.js```.

3. ```npm build``` will bundle your script and paste it to ```/spark-project/scripts/```
